# f(x)

A helper function library for working with objects and arrays. I made all the functions pure as a challenge.

## Installation

`npm i @dodiameer/fx` or `yarn add @dodiameer/fx` or `pnpm i @dodiameer/fx`

## Documentation

TODO. For now, all the functions have JSDoc comments so import and see if it's useful to you.
